        <p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2020 will occur on Saturday,
           October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, when people would 
           light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated 
           November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon, All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. 
           The evening before was known as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved 
           into a day of activities like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, donning
           costumes and eating treats.</p>

        <h2>Ancient Origins of Halloween</h2>
        <p>Halloween’s origins date back to the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain (pronounced sow-in). 
           The Celts, who lived 2,000 years ago, mostly in the area that is now Ireland, the United 
           Kingdom and northern France, celebrated their new year on November 1.
           This day marked the end of summer and the harvest and the beginning of the dark, cold winter, 
           a time of year that was often associated with human death. Celts believed that on the night 
           before the new year, the boundary between the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred. 
           On the night of October 31 they celebrated Samhain, when it was believed that the ghosts of 
           the dead returned to earth.</p>
